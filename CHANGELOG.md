# Changelog

## [0.50.0] — 2026-05-06

### Added
- **Print pagination** — CSS page-break rules prevent orphaned headings and split drug entries across pages in all three report types
- **Report generation timestamps** — footer on Clinical Report, PowerChart Letter, and Patient Handout shows when the report was saved (uses activeReportSavedAt)
- **Redacted view toggle** — new EyeOff button in the report tab bar replaces patient identifiers with ——- for demos and training; ephemeral (not persisted, print always shows full data)
- **Redact context provider** — useRedact.tsx hook provides isRedacted, toggleRedact, and redact() across all report components and text exports
- **Controls empty state** — Clinical Report shows No controls recorded when all control values are empty
- **Unit tests for testingUtils** — covers isSkinTestPositive, getPositiveResults, getNegativeResults, getCrossSensitizationNotes, buildRecommendations
- **Unit tests for deidentify** — 15 test cases covering name stripping, REDCap passthrough, challenge handling, legacy IDT fields, custom drug names

### Changed
- **ResearchDrugResult type** — idt_100, idt_10, idt_neat consolidated to single idt_results string field
- **ResearchDashboard** — IDT columns consolidated to match new type
- **testingDataFactory** — added missing selectedProtocols to TestingPlanData factory
- **Print headers** — section-card wrappers added to all major report sections

### Fixed
- **Flaky SPT input test** — simplified assertion from waitFor + toHaveValue to direct .value check after fireEvent.change

## [0.49.0] — 2026-05-06 (Pancuronium)

### Added
- **Tryptase paragraph in eMR letter** — new Tryptase section in the testing form captures whether samples were obtained, whether there was clinically significant dynamic elevation, and up to 4 timed sample values; renders as one of three standardised sentences in the PowerChart letter
- **Roc/Vec cross-sensitization** — if Rocuronium tests positive, a cross-sensitization note for Vecuronium is automatically added to both reports (and vice versa); cross-sensitized drug also appears in the AVOID list
- **Restructured Recommendations** — eMR letter and clinical report now lead with `AVOID [DRUG]` in bold for each positive result, followed by standardised bullets (updated eMR allergy, GP/MyHealth Record, MedicAlert for muscle relaxants, patient copy of letter); all-negative records show "No evidence of IgE-mediated allergy to medications tested."
- **Nursing Notes section** — collapsible blue card in the testing form for pre-testing, during, and post-testing observations plus nurse sign-off; renders in the clinical report only (excluded from the eMR PowerChart letter)
- **IV drug challenge in eMR letter** — challenge outcome (tolerated / reaction with details) now appears as a dedicated "Drug Challenge" block in the PowerChart letter
- **REDCap testing-plan parity** — app now reads the explicit testing-plan instrument checkboxes from the REDCap CSV and uses them as the source of truth for auto-selecting drugs; falls back to reaction-drug inference when not present; includes documents-to-chase parsing
- **6-hour report retention** — active report is persisted to localStorage with a 6-hour TTL; a banner on the log screen shows the active report with Open/Clear actions; "Exit" no longer clears the report

### Changed
- **eMR letter simplified** — removed SPT/IDT measurement table; eMR letter now lists drug names only (measurements stay in the full clinical report)
- **Patient handout** — AVOID list now includes cross-sensitized drugs with a "cross-sensitization risk" note

## [0.48.0] — 2025-05-16 (Atracurium)

### Fixed
- **Phone number** — updated contact number to (02) 9515 7586
- **Parecoxib IDT** — removed 1:1,000 dilution step from skin testing protocol
- **Propofol consolidation** — collapsed from two protocols to single IV protocol; removed IDT 1:100 step
- **Sugammadex multi-protocol selection** — Sugammadex Alone and +Rocuronium can now be selected simultaneously without deselecting each other
- **Print headers/footers** — suppressed browser-generated headers (URL, date, page numbers) in Chrome/Edge via `@page { margin: 0 }` with compensating body padding
- **Empty result fields** — changed input type from `number` to `text` with `inputMode="decimal"` so the "-" placeholder displays correctly on all browsers

### Added
- **Drug persistence from testing plan** — drugs selected in the testing plan now carry over to the testing panel when proceeding, pre-populating the test grid
- **`toggleDrugProtocol`** — new hook function allowing per-protocol drug toggling for multi-variant drugs

## [0.47.0] — 2026-05-14 (Neostigmine)

### Fixed
- **Toast notifications** — removed rounded corners from toast notifications for consistent clinical aesthetic
- **Print background** — forced pure white background in print view via CSS variable override
- **Print section headers** — removed gray backgrounds from section headers in print view
- **Signature lines** — signature fields now use bottom border with writing space above

## [0.46.0] — 2026-03-26 (Neostigmine)

### Added
- **Multi-sample tryptase model** — REDCap CSV now parses up to 4 timed tryptase samples (`Serum Tryptase Time/Result` × 4) per patient; clinic investigation fallback (`Biochemical Results: Tryptase 1–4`) also supported
- **Tryptase display with timestamps** — patient history card shows `T1 (08:45): 12 ng/mL · T2 (10:30): 45 ng/mL` for multi-sample data; single-string values from mock data display unchanged
- **Audit export updated** — `Tryptase` column in de-identified CSV serialises all samples as semicolon-separated entries

## [0.45.0] — 2026-03-26 (Suxamethonium-B)

### Added
- **Mock testing session logs** — 12 clinically realistic `LogFormData` records seeded on first load; powers "Recent Skin Testing Activity" in the Clinical Dashboard for demo
- **Mock patient coverage test** — 9 machine-checkable Vitest assertions guard NMBA / antibiotic / NSAID / Grade I–IV / Completed / Chlorhexidine+Latex coverage in `MOCK_PATIENTS`
- **NSAID mock patient** — Natalie Brennan (Aspirin/Celecoxib, Grade II, MRN 44) added to fill coverage gap
- **E2E testing day flow** — Playwright spec covering full hero workflow: patient select → drug grid → save → Clinical Report → print → Dashboard → Recent Testing Activity

---

## [0.44.0] — 2026-03-25 (Suxamethonium)

### Added
- **Drug protocol library** (`drugMasterlist.ts`) — SPT concentration, IDT dilution steps, and challenge flags for all 70+ supported drugs
- **Dynamic IDT columns** — testing grid columns driven by per-drug protocol (replaces hardcoded idt100/10/Neat columns)

- **Custom protocol editor** — users can override SPT concentration, IDT dilution steps, and challenge flag per drug per session
- **Drug search/filter** — filter field in testing form and plan generator
- **Proton Pump Inhibitors category** — Esomeprazole, Lansoprazole, Omeprazole, Pantoprazole added to drug list

---

## [0.43.0] — 2026-03-23 (Rapacuronium)

### Added
- **Skeleton loaders** — PatientTable shows 10-row shimmer skeleton (desktop) / 5-card shimmer (mobile) while mock data loads asynchronously on first render
- **Context-aware empty states** — PatientTable now distinguishes between "no data loaded" (Upload icon + CTA) and "no filter matches" (italic hint), instead of a single generic message
- **Research shimmer** — ResearchDashboard replaces spinning icon with 4 shimmer bars during Supabase fetch
- **Export SkeletonText / SkeletonCard** from `components/ui/index.tsx`

### Changed
- `isLoadingPatients` flag threaded from `usePatientState` → `useAnaestheticApp` → `App.tsx` → `Dashboard` → `PatientTable`

---

## [0.42.0] — 2026-03-22 (Pancuronium)

### Changed
- **Bundle optimisation** — mock patient data lazy-loaded as a separate on-demand chunk (~44 kB removed from initial load); `react-hot-toast` removed from `notifications` manualChunks (stale entry)
- `requestAnimationFrame` replaces `setTimeout(50ms)` for chart animation trigger in Dashboard

---

## [0.41.0] — 2026-03-22 (Orocuronium)

### Added

- Save success toast after test record submission
- Delete feedback toasts in ResearchDashboard (success + error with detail)

### Fixed
- Silent broken toasts — `react-hot-toast` had no `<Toaster>` mounted; all CSV upload and save messages were swallowed
